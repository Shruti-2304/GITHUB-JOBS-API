## Key Commands(Create React App)

### `npm start`  
What it does: Starts the application in development mode.

Access: You can visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your app running.

Live Updates: Any changes you make will automatically refresh the page, and you'll be notified of linting errors in the console.

### `npm test`  
What it does: Runs the test suite in an interactive mode, which watches for changes and re-runs tests.

Purpose: Handy for continuous testing during development.

### `npm run build`
What it does: Prepares the app for production, creating optimized and minified files.

Output: The `build` directory will contain the production-ready files, with filenames that include hashes to ensure browser caching works properly.

### `npm run eject`
What it does: Exposes the underlying configuration (Webpack, Babel, etc.) so you can modify it directly.

Warning: This action is irreversible—once ejected, you’re responsible for managing all configurations yourself. While most projects don’t need this, it’s available for those needing more control over the setup.

### `Should You Eject?`
Ejecting is only recommended if you need advanced customization that isn't possible with the default Create React App setup. For most small to medium projects, the default configuration will suffice.
